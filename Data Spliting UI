Yes ‚Äî your idea is **absolutely doable and it's actually a very smart architecture** for handling large data efficiently in MaterialReactTable or any modern frontend table component.

## ‚úÖ Your Strategy Recap

You‚Äôre suggesting:

> **Split large data into Parent ‚Üí Child1 ‚Üí Child2 (hierarchical)**  
> ‚ûï **Lazy load children only when needed**  
> ‚ûï **When searching, combine all matches from all levels into a flat, virtualized view**

‚úÖ **This is a hybrid strategy combining:**
- Lazy loading for performance
- Virtualization for rendering
- Hierarchical flattening for flexible search

---

## üí° How to Approach This (Conceptually)

### 1. **Data Split:**
- **Parent Data**: Loaded on initial render
- **Child1 & Child2**: Fetched on-demand when parent expands (or when search hits those levels)

### 2. **Search Implementation:**
When a user searches:
- Hit **Parent + Child1 + Child2** APIs (if not already cached).
- Combine matching records into a **flat structure** like:

```ts
[
  { id: 'P1', level: 'parent', name: 'John Doe' },
  { id: 'C1', level: 'child1', name: 'Sam Doe', parentId: 'P1' },
  { id: 'C2', level: 'child2', name: 'Mike Doe', parentId: 'C1' }
]
```

Then show them in a **flat virtualized table** (without expansion) for results view.

### 3. **Switch Between Views:**
- ü™Ñ **Normal View**: Tree (expandable with lazy load)
- üîç **Search View**: Flat table (fast + all matches from all levels)

You can toggle this view using a `searchMode` flag in state:
```ts
const [searchMode, setSearchMode] = useState(false);
const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState([]);
```

## üß† Benefits of This Approach

| Feature                        | Benefit                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lazy loading of children       | Saves memory and network usage                                          |
| Flat search result view        | Extremely performant with virtualization                               |
| Split-level filtering          | Lets you scale each level independently (filter only parents, etc.)    |
| Modular API design             | Lets BE optimize responses, cache hits, paginate children separately    |

## üì¶ Tech Stack Suggestions (Optional)

| Goal                     | Tools / Techniques                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Fast UI rendering        | `MaterialReactTable` + `rowVirtualizer`   |
| Efficient data fetching  | `React Query`, `SWR`, or `RTK Query`      |
| Background sync/caching  | `React Query + staleTime/cacheTime`       |
| Complex querying         | Consider GraphQL or custom REST endpoints |

## üîÑ Example UX Flow

1. User opens table ‚Üí parent data loaded instantly.
2. User expands a row ‚Üí child1 API is called ‚Üí subRows appear with spinner.
3. User searches "Mike Doe" ‚Üí you:
   - Run search logic on parent and fetch child1/child2 APIs in parallel (if needed)
   - Combine results into a **flat list** and show in search view (virtualized)
4. Clear search ‚Üí return to normal expandable view.

## ‚úÖ YES ‚Äî this is a scalable and powerful architecture.
