NGinx 

Even if 100 users access your app, ECS does NOT create a new container/task for each user.
Your front-end app (served via nginx) runs inside one or more containers, and each container handles multiple user requests concurrently.

Loads the React app (served via nginx)
    Downloads:
        index.html (~5KB)
        main.js (~300KB)
        style.css (~100KB)
        Other assets (images, fonts) — ~500KB
    Makes 10 API calls (some returning 25MB each)



nginx Memory Impact Estimation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task	 											Memory Impact
Serving static assets (HTML, JS, CSS)				 ~1–2 MB max (very efficient)
Proxying small API responses						 ~1–2 MB (buffered briefly)
Proxying large API response (25MB × 2)				 ~50–60 MB temporary buffer usage
Total for one active user (peak during full load)	 ~60–70 MB (temporary peak)

One user can cause nginx to use ~60–70MB extra RAM temporarily, especially when large API responses are being buffered.


 if 100+ users access nginx memory will increase if requests are concurrent and large When responses are huge (25MB+), or you get high concurrency Tune buffers, increase ECS RAM, use CDNs, monitor usage, gzip responses
